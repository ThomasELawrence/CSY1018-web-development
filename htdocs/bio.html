    <p class="paragraphs">When I was, younger I loved to play with Lego putting it together one way and then pulling my creation apart to put it back together in a different way. (to be honest I still enjoy playing with it now).</p>
    <p class="paragraphs">When working on this website that you are looking at now, it felt like working with Lego again as I would type my code in one way then after looking at it I pulled some of it apart and put it back together in a different way to a way that I liked.</p>
    <p class="paragraphs">My creative side helps me with designing posters, leaflets and my website, while my problem-solving side helps me to work out problems that I may come across as I am working through my pieces of work.</p>
    <p class="paragraphs">I like to surround myself with technology so that I can play games, work and belt out my favourite songs thinking that I am a professional (we can all dream, right?).</p>
    <p class="paragraphs">I enjoy socialising with friends, using a variety of platforms, such as going to the cinema and online gaming, not to mention enjoying snacks, fizzy drinks and the company of dogs in the process.</p>
