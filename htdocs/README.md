In this assignment, I have implemented a number of things some worked other did
not meaning I had to find another way of getting the same result.

The aspects that worked within my work are Head titles for each page and for the beginning of important information.
Paragraphs to display the main bulk of the information that was needed to get across.
links to be able to access another page from one you are on (eg from the home page to the Bio page) also to link the css   style sheet to the html document so that I could style the html with google fonts, moving text and images, backgrounds for  text to make it stand out.
At first the implementation of images did not work for me but then Luke Merritt pointed out to me that I was missing a small piece of code which was (images\) this helped me get back on track as then the image would load in my preview and online.
Placing listed information into unordered lists making the information look more appealing on the page.
Adding the static form on the contact page was quite tricky to implement at first but with some trial and error I managed to get it to work properly on both the html document and the css style sheet.

Some of the aspects that did not work were: trying to use flex on my images as I tried different flex methods but the images did not want to move from the left-hand side to the centre of the page, so instead I used (display: block; margin: auto;)    this helped move the images into the locations that I wanted.

In total creating this document took about 20 hours of creating and double checking.
